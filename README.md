# IntelliFlow: Adaptive Traffic Control with Green Corridor ðŸš¦ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

-----

## Overview

**IntelliFlow** is an innovative Adaptive Traffic Control System designed to optimize urban traffic flow and prioritize emergency vehicle movement. Utilizing **Arduino Uno** for hardware control, **OpenCV** and **Python** for intelligent vision processing, this project implements a density-based traffic management solution with a unique **"Green Corridor"** feature for emergency vehicles.

-----

## Features

  * **Density-Based Traffic Management:** Dynamically adjusts green and red light timings at intersections based on real-time vehicle density, reducing congestion.
    \*
  * **Green Corridor for Emergency Vehicles:** Detects emergency vehicles in real-time and creates a continuous green light path, ensuring swift and unhindered passage.
    \*
  * **Computer Vision Integration:** Leverages **OpenCV** and **Python** for accurate vehicle detection, classification (including emergency vehicles), and traffic density analysis.
    \*
  * **Hardware Control:** Uses **Arduino Uno** to interface with traffic lights and manage signal sequences based on processed data.
    \*
  * **Scalable Solution:** Designed with modularity to potentially extend to multiple intersections.

## Technical Specifications

  * **Hardware:**
      * Arduino Uno
      * Traffic light modules (LEDs)
      * Camera module (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera, USB webcam)
      * Connecting wires, breadboard
      * 
  * **Software:**
      * Python 3.x
      * OpenCV Library
      * NumPy
      * Serial communication library (e.g., `pyserial`)
      * Arduino IDE

## How It Works

1.  **Vehicle Detection:** A camera positioned at the intersection captures real-time video feed.
2.  **Density Analysis:** The Python script, using OpenCV, processes the video to detect vehicles and calculate the traffic density for each lane/road segment.
3.  **Emergency Vehicle Detection:** Advanced computer vision algorithms identify specific patterns (e.g., unique lights, shapes) to detect emergency vehicles.
4.  **Signal Timing Adjustment:**
      * Based on traffic density, the system calculates optimal green and red light durations for each lane.
      * If an emergency vehicle is detected, the system overrides normal timing to create a "Green Corridor," turning all necessary signals green in its path.
5.  **Arduino Control:** The calculated signal timings are sent via serial communication to the Arduino Uno, which then controls the physical traffic lights.

2.  **Python Script:**
      * Navigate to the `python_scripts` directory.
      * Update the `COM_PORT` variable in `main.py` to match your Arduino's serial port.
      * Adjust camera index if necessary (e.g., `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)`).
